# Prosody_Analysis_Toolkit

Partly adapted from Nigel's midlevel matlab toolkit: https://github.com/nigelgward/midlevel/tree/master
All_in_one.py consists of all the individual functions.
To use the functions, please extract necessary speech signals by yourself beforehand using soundfile, librosa, or any others.
