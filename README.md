# Prosody_Processing_Toolkit

Partly adapted from Nigel's midlevel matlab toolkit: https://github.com/nigelgward/midlevel/tree/master

Improved for batch processing and tensor computation.

Being modified to be integrated into SpeechBrain.

Prosody_processing.py supports np.array input and individual file processing only.
Prosody_processing_batch.py supports tensor input and batch processing.

To use the functions, please extract waveform by yourself.
